Understanding Satisfaction with Salary and Work-Life 

### Balance
The scores for salary satisfaction and work-life balance give an overview of how professionals feel about their compensation and job environment.
This could help employers identify areas to improve, such as adjusting salaries or promoting better work-life balance to retain talent.

### Identifying Popular Countries for Data Jobs
The dashboard shows the number of survey participants from each country, helping to identify where most data professionals are located.
It could highlight countries with a higher concentration of data professionals and potentially higher competition for such jobs.

### A Profile of the Data Workforce
The average age statistic helps frame a picture of the typical demographic working in data-related roles.
By combining age, salary, and satisfaction, companies can understand the needs of the data workforce at various career stages.

### Help Data Professionals Benchmark Themselves
The survey and resulting dashboard provides valuable insights for data professionals to compare their salary and satisfaction with global trends.
It could serve as a tool for negotiating better salaries or career development opportunities.
