## Dashboard Overview

### Key Metrics Cards

### Total Sales by Month (Line Chart)

This visual depicts the month-over-month fluctuation in total sales. Notable sales peaks in July ($81M) and December ($86M) are likely influenced by seasonal demand (e.g., holiday seasons, summer collections). Dips in other months (e.g., February at $57M) point to off-peak periods that could benefit from targeted promotional strategies.

### Total Sales by State (Shape Map)
A geographical representation of sales distribution across U.S. states. This map identifies top-performing states and regions, offering insights for region-specific marketing efforts. Higher sales concentration in certain areas may indicate successful retail strategies or higher market penetration.

### Total Sales by Region (Donut Chart)
Sales distribution across the West (18.13%), South (18.18%), Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest regions. The West and South regions lead in sales contribution, suggesting where Adidas's strongest customer bases are located. These insights can guide resource allocation and regional promotions.

### Total Sales by Product (Bar Chart)
A breakdown of sales by product category reveals the top-performing products. Men’s Street Fashion ($209M) and Women’s Apparel ($179M) lead, suggesting areas where Adidas’s branding and product offerings align well with consumer preferences. In contrast, lower sales in Men’s Apparel ($124M) may warrant product improvements or focused marketing.

### Total Sales by Retailer (Bar Chart)
This visualization showcases retailer performance, with West Gear and Foot Locker being the top contributors. Monitoring these partnerships allows Adidas to nurture high-performing relationships while addressing underperforming channels like Amazon and Walmart, which show lower sales contributions.

## Key Insights & Outcomes

### Sales Seasonality
The sales spike in summer and holiday months confirms seasonal demand patterns. Adidas can capitalize on these peaks by aligning product launches and promotional campaigns with these high-sales periods.

### Regional Focus
Higher sales in the West and South regions suggest a stronger brand presence in those areas, while other regions may need targeted strategies to improve market penetration.

### Product Strategy
Men's Street Fashion and Women’s Apparel are clearly leading product lines, indicating strong consumer interest in these categories. Adidas can explore expanding these lines or introducing complementary products to boost revenue. Underperforming categories like Men’s Apparel could benefit from adjustments in design, marketing, or pricing.

### Retail Channel Optimization
Retailers like West Gear and Foot Locker should be prioritized in partnership management, while low-contributing retailers may require reevaluation or restructuring of sales agreements to drive more value.

## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard provides Adidas with an in-depth look at its sales performance from multiple angles, highlighting key opportunities for growth and optimization. By leveraging this data, Adidas can make informed decisions on where to focus marketing efforts, how to optimize product lines, and which retail partnerships to strengthen for continued success.
